# TESTER 1(a) 12V w/ Software 🚀

A **modern** and **open-source** conductivity tester powered by **Arduino Uno** and **Processing Java**. It not only checks conductivity but also **visualizes** the data in real-time with a sleek UI, graphs, and even lets you save sample values!

## Features 🎯

- **Real-time Conductivity Visualization** 🌊⚡
  - Displays **raw conductivity values** + **converted S/m values**.
  - Graphs conductivity **over time** 📊.
  - Indicates if conductivity is **low, mid, or high**.
- **Physical Conductivity Checker** 🛠️
  - Uses **+ and - wires** for testing.
  - **LED Indicators**: 🔴 1 LED = Low Conductivity, 🔴🔴 2 LEDs = High Conductivity.
- **Sample Saving** 💾
  - Store readings like **"Lemon Juice: 1.5 S/m"** for future reference.
- **Super Modern UI** 🎨🔥
  - Looks like a **Nothing product™** lol.
  - Easy-to-use with a **graphical conductivity meter**.
- **Requires external power** ⚡
  - Needs **PC (for both power & software)** or a **power bank** to function.

## Setup & Installation 🛠️

### **Hardware**
1. **Arduino Uno**
2. **2 LEDs**
3. **+ & - Conductivity Wires**
4. **12V Power Supply (PC or Power Bank)**

### **Software**
1. Install **[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)**.
2. Install **[Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download/)**.
3. Upload the `arduino_tester.ino` code to your Arduino Uno.
4. Run `processing_visualizer.pde` on your PC.

## Usage 🚀
- **Connect** the Arduino to **COM4**.
- Attach wires to the substance **to test conductivity**.
- Observe LED indicators & **live visualization on PC**.
- Save sample values for reference!
